# Ethical Hacking (CTF) Workshop 

**Date:** Tuesday, November 8th, 2022 <br>
**Description**: In this workshop you will learn the basics of **Capture the Flag and Ethical Hacking**. We will execute some of the most common attacks Cybersecurity experts face. You will also get hands on practice via a Capture the Flag (CTF) game. For more information on CTF's and other resources talked about during the meeting please continue looking below for all **resources** and **descriptions for each demo**. <br>
**Workshop Zoom Recording**: [TBD]() <br>

## Steganography
**Pre-Requisite**: 
    - [ ] **Digital Invisibile Ink Toolkit** 
    - [ ] **What does this program do**: a Java steganography tool that can hide any sort of file inside a digital image
    - [ ] [Link to program](https://sourceforge.net/projects/diit/files/diit/1.5/diit-1.5.jar/download?use_mirror=cytranet)
    - [ ] [Demo_File](https://i.imgur.com/66qJWwL.jpg)

**What is it**: Steganography is the practice of concealing a message within another message or a physical object
**What will we be doing in this demo**: Extracting a file within an image

## Cryptography
**Pre-Requisite**: 
    - [ ] **Cipher Decoder**: [Click Here](https://www.dcode.fr/)
    - [ ] **Website containing a multitude of ciphers, and tools to decode/encode material**:
    - [ ] [Demo_File](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/qq6wmaqtknyh8w2ga5yrw/h?dl=0&rlkey=wwf45y7dneckc3dvoq1m3rhy8)

**What is it**: In computer science, cryptography refers to secure information and communication techniques derived from mathematical concepts and a set of rule-based calculations called algorithms, to transform messages in ways that are hard to decipher.
**What will we be doing in this demo**: Manuvering and decipher through files in order to acquire a flag.
